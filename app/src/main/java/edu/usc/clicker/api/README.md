## ClickerAPI
Java interface that defines all the API calls we use in Clicker for Android.

Using Retrofit (and its reflection magic) this is built into a ClickerAPI class with working functions that make API calls according to the annotations on each function declaration.

More information on Retrofit and how to use it can be found at [http://square.github.io/retrofit/](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
